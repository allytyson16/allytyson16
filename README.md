### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I like being in my own skin
- ğŸŒ± Sociable but I only have acquaintances.
- ğŸ‘¯ 4/3 of the things I say are jokes, no vex I beg.
- ğŸ¤” I prefer doing my own thing my own way but I accept polite views.
- ğŸ’¬ Want to know how to get crispsy fried egg? crispsy fried yam? crispsy extra spicy sausage? wonder no more @adelaideyeboah2@gmail.com knows how that's done.
- ğŸ“« Prefer forks to spoons, maybe might prefer knives to forks when I have attained a lot.
- ğŸ˜„ Prefer wolves to dogs and cats.
- âš¡ I am a vampire myself.
- ğŸŒ± Witty is what I am.
